In this case, since we making the defect data publicly available, it may help other researchers try other Java-based SBF tools.<br><br>In addition, AUCEC per se has been criticized for ignoring the cost of false negatives (missed defects [29]). We hope that our making this hard-won warnings & defect data available will encourage repetition of this trial with other measures.<br><br>We acknowledge these arguments, but claim our procedure defines a reasonable baseline for a longoverdue comparison; we hope that our dataset will enable other types of future analysis of the CBI problem.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Future plans (—)                                                                    | No                     |

EA supports a large number of users concurrently and is used by millions of users worldwide on a daily basis. We sought to use open source systems, in addition to the commercial system, so others can verify our findings and replicate our experiments on the open source systems, as we are not able to provide access to the EA.<br><br>Due to non-disclosure agreement (NDA), we cannot present the exact numbers of detected anti-patterns in EA. However, we can confirm that our framework is able to detect many of the existing and new performance problems in EA.<br><br>Figure 3 (EA is excluded due to NDA) shows that most software packages do not have instances of performance anti-patterns (e.g., more than 60% of the packages in Broadleaf have almost zero performance antipattern instance), and only about 15–35% of the packages in Broadleaf have anti-pattern instances.<br><br>We rank the packages by the number of performance anti-pattern instances (both excessive data and one-by-one processing together) contained in each package, and list the names in Table 5.

Instead, we demonstrate the usability problems using simplified versions of the participants’ pieces of code.<br><br>CodingSpectator captures snippets of code close to the program elements under refactoring. We found that this information was crucial for deriving usability problems. Nonetheless, recording such sensitive pieces of information raises privacy and confidentiality issues. We faced difficulty in recruiting participants because of these issues. There are several challenges in scaling our method to a large number of programmers.

Second, our data-collection logic and analysis pipelines are governed by Wandoujia employees3 to ensure compliance with the commitments of Wandoujia privacy stated in the Term-of-Use statements. Third and the most significantly, Wandoujia employees anonymize the user identifiers before any data analysis. Only aggregated statistics are produced for the users covered in our study period. Finally, we obtain the approval from the research ethnics committee of School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University to conduct this research.<br><br>3The last author is the co-founder and CTO of Wandoujia.

Each report has two attributes Application and DataCenter (apart from the Time and ID attributes). The Application attribute has 5 values (A1-A5). The DataCenter attributes has 10 values (DC1- DC10). There are total 92 emerging issues in this dataset, which are verified by the domain experts in the product team.3 Due to sensitivity reasons, we omit and anonymize the detail information about the dataset.<br><br>In this section, we present two successful stories of iDice.

The described methods rely heavily on the given dataset, which is derived from a single application. Some programs may log users and their actions and others may lack the logging details we used, providing only aggregate command and session logs.

| 0010             | *Ethical Considerations: Our institution approved the use of this dataset because Play reviews are already public. In compliance with ethical training guidelines in our institution, we ensured that users’ privacy were respected. We thus carried out the following. First, all researchers have been trained in ethical user research prior to this study. Second, the dataset was preprocessed to remove user identifiers and app names before the researchers were given access. The only accompanying metadata beyond the review text, was the app’s category name and the publish timestamp. Third, access to this version of the dataset is limited to the authors of this paper.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); Barriers (Agreements and legal rights)      | No                     |

For recruiting, we did not require official emails or company names, and allowed interviews with the camera off (after pre-screening with it on to verify identity). We employed a particularly high standard of confidentiality, including not releasing the interview text (which may contain identifying information admitting retaliation) without a data sharing agreement (e.g., via additional IRB certification, etc.). Finally, we obtained IRB permission to waive written informed consent (a paper trail linking the participant’s real name to the research) in favor of oral informed consent. These steps are pragmatically necessary (e.g., so people feel comfortable speaking truths), but, more importantly, are ethically necessary (to protect participants).* | Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); Limited access (Access given upon request)  | Yes                    |

| 2303             | *VII. DATA AVAILABILITY<br>GitHub is a popular platform for publishing versioncontrolled software and is used by employers to discover potential candidates and browse their development work. Accordingly, the software engineering students who participated in this study were allowed/encouraged to share their work for assignments on GitHub as a portfolio to showcase their skills.<br>However, since their work may be shared publicly, their original assignment submissions cannot be shared without violating confidentiality protected by the human subject policies set by my university’s Institutional Review Board. Even if I sanitized the code of identifying comments/usernames/etc., internet searches of segments of their code could result in identifying students’ GitHub accounts and thereby, their personal identities. Consequently, the raw data of student submissions is not available for end-to-end reproduction of this study<br>Nevertheless, the published supplemental material [28] shares spreadsheets that provide analysis of each (anonymized) student’s performance on the CRT, manual verification questions, and unit test assessments. These spreadsheets replace personally-identifying information with unique participant codes (e.g. p001).
